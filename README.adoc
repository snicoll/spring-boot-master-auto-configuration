== Master Spring Boot auto-configuration

This is the sample app used during the Master Spring Boot auto-configuration talk.

This repository contains one commit per step to reach a complete auto-configuration. Refer to the commit messages for more information on what each step does.

NOTE: The slides of the session are https://speakerdeck.com/snicoll/master-spring-boot-auto-configuration[available on speakerdeck].

=== Building and running

Some of these steps require a local HornetQ installation. You can download HornetQ http://hornetq.jboss.org/downloads.html[from the official web site].

You can start with a basic example that uses Spring Boot's HornetQ support with the following command in this repository:

```
git checkout 7ef8191
```

[NOTE]
====
This demo requires a `testQueue` to be created in your local broker. To do so, open the `hornetq-jms.xml` configuration file and add the following entry:
```xml
<queue name="testQueue">
    <entry name="/queue/testQueue"/>
</queue>
```
====

Once you reach the point where the official HornetQ support is removed, you can either checkout https://github.com/snicoll/spring-boot/tree/auto-config-demo[snicoll/auto-config-demo] and build that locally (`mvn clean install`) to get a customized `1.2.4-BUILD.SNAPSHOT`) or exclude the `HornetQAutoConfiguration` (see `DemoApplication`).
